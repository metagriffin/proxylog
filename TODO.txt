* add support for SSL
  ==> obviously, the client must ignore cert warnings
  ==> or the client is HTTP, but the outbound request is HTTPS.

* add syntax prettification of json/yaml. is there a library
  to do this? (pygments only colorizes... i want it restructured)

* clean up colorizing vs. structurizing...

* create support for a config file, eg ~/.config/proxylog.conf,
  for: default color theme
